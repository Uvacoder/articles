## Hello World

Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹, I'm [Khatab Wedaa](https://twitter.com/khatabwedaa), the last one to join the TailwindComponents team ðŸ¤ . Lst MAY [AgustÃ­n RodrÃ­guez](https://twitter.com/killgt) asked me to work on the [premium](https://tailwindcomponents.com/premium) section, and i have been building many components and templates for the new section, you should check them!.

Last week we start working on new blog section to write about Tailwindcss news, tips and tricks.

Today I will talk about Tailwindcomponents beginnings and how become the site that we use it today. I will talk about time line not the details ðŸ˜…, the website built by [AgustÃ­n](https://twitter.com/killgt) and his co-worker akampana these guys are co-workers since 10 years ðŸ¤¯ and now they are directing a incubator department in [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/).

AgustÃ­n started this site on 2017 with the first alpha version of Tailwindcss, was filling a gap in the docs and there was nothing like it for Tailwindcss. Tailwindcomponents grows steadily as Tailwindcss gets more popular, in that time Killgt tell akampana to join the team and they upgrade the website for the version that we use it today.

Finaly after three years [AgustÃ­n](https://twitter.com/killgt) become very busy man ðŸ˜‚ after he joined [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/) company, he asked me to join the team to help the project continue growing and here i am. 

That is our short story of Tailwindcomponents Team, i want to thank all the people who create and submit their awesome Tailwindcss components.

See you next time.
