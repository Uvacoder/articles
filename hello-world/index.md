## Hello World

Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹, I'm [Khatab Wedaa](https://twitter.com/khatabwedaa) one of the Tailwindcomponents team. the last one in the team ðŸ¤ , I joined the team last MAY [Killgt](https://twitter.com/killgt) asked me to work on the [premium](https://tailwindcomponents.com/premium) section in the website I built many components and template for that section, if you don't check i think you should.

In last week we start working on new blog section on the website to write some articles for Tailwindcss news, tips and tricks.

Today I will talk about Tailwindcomponents the start and how become the Tailwindcomponents that we use it today I will talk about time line not the details ðŸ˜…, the website built by [Killgt](https://twitter.com/killgt) and his co-worker akampana these guys are co-workers since 10 years ðŸ¤¯ and now they are directing a incubator department in [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/).

Killgt started this site on 2017 with the first version of Tailwindcss, was filling a gap in the docs and there was nothing like it for Tailwindcss, Tailwindcomponents grows steadily as Tailwindcss gets more popular in that time Killgt tell akampana to join the team and they upgrade the website for the version that we use it today.

Finaly after three years [Killgt](https://twitter.com/killgt) become very busy man ðŸ˜‚ after he start working on [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/) componay, he asked me to join the team and I am here. That is our short story of Tailwindcomponents Team in the end thanks for all people who create awesome Tailwindcss components and share it with us.
